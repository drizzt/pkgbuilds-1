Note: these all default to 1 (On), so you would set them to '0' to turn
them off. E.g., in your .vimrc or _vimrc file:

    let php_special_functions = 0
    let php_alt_comparisons = 0
    let php_alt_assignByReference = 0

Unletting these variables will revert back to their default (On).

Known Bugs:
- setting php_parent_error_close to 1 and php_parent_error_open to 0
  has these two leaks:
  i)  A closing ) or ] inside a string match to the last open ( or [
      before the string, when the the closing ) or ] is on the same line
      where the string started. In this case a following ) or ] after
      the string would be highlighted as an error, what is incorrect.
  ii) Same problem if you are setting php_folding = 2 with a closing }
      inside an string on the first line of this string.
