# vim-hugefile-git

Vim always loads entire files. Therefore loading huge files (logfiles?) is
pretty slow. And having the usual options set makes loading even slower.

This plugin reduces the impact of the latter heavily by disabling these
options for all huge files:

- FileType autocmds
- syntax highlighting
- folding
- swapfile
- MatchParen

This happens automatically for all files that are bigger or equal to
2 MiB. You can change this value by setting g:hugefile_trigger_size
(in MiB) in your vimrc.

Before the options for handling huge files are set, your old settings
get saved. :HugefileToggle toggles the current state.
