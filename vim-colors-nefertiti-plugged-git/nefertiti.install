Nefertiti
=========

Brighten select (normal and syntax) colors with ":NefertitiBrighten",
or darken them with ":NefertitiDarken". Conveniently bound to "META-2"
and "META-1", respectively, but you can, of course, suppress the key
mappings and/or replace them with others of your own preference.

If you want to define your own key mappings, then add something like
the following to your '~/.vimrc':

    let g:nefertiti_suppress_keymaps = 1
    map <silent> <D-F1> <Plug>NefertitiDarken
    map <silent> <D-F2> <Plug>NefertitiBrighten
    map <silent> <D-F3> <Plug>NefertitiReset

NOTE:
    (1) GUI Vim only at the present time.
    (2) Previously known as "MochaLatte"

Nefertiti lives at:

and more details as well as, e.g. screen shots, can be found there.
