Pencil
======

The pencil color scheme takes its inspiration from iA Writer, an elegant
word processor available on the iOS and OSX platforms.

This Vim color scheme features:

- Subtle indicators of changes in the gutter for Signify, git-gutter, etc.
- Use for both code and prose, though it’s definitely geared towards
  the latter
- Light and dark background variants
- iTerm color scheme available for using this color scheme with
  terminal-based Vim
- Support for tpope/vim-markdown, plasticboy/vim-markdown, and
  gabrielelana/vim-markdown
- Support for the bling/vim-airline status bar plugin
- Support for Vim’s Conceal feature to hide _ and * markup for _italic_,
  **bold** and ***bold italic*** styled text in Markdown

Contrast
--------

If you’re looking for greater contrast, set the following in your
.vimrc:

    let g:pencil_higher_contrast_ui = 0   " 0=low (def), 1=high

It currently only affects the blacks and grays.

Headings color
--------------

When using a filetype of markdown, the ‘#’ heading text is shaded
dark blue by default. This compensates for the lack of a visual cue found
in iA Writer where the heading indicators are inside the left margin.

If you’re looking for neutral heading colors, set the following in
your .vimrc:

    let g:pencil_neutral_headings = 1   " 0=blue (def), 1=normal

Terminal Italics
----------------

If you're using Vim in the terminal and your terminal supports italics,
you can opt-in to italic support for some syntax highlighting, such as
comments, by setting the following in your .vimrc:

    let g:pencil_terminal_italics = 1

Airline Theme
-------------

A matching theme for the Airline status bar plugin is available. Enable
by adding to your .vimrc:

    let g:airline_theme = 'pencil'

Concealing __styling markup__ in Markdown
-----------------------------------------

The pencil color scheme supports the highlighting groups in the
tpope/vim-markdown syntax plugin, to take advantage of Vim’s Conceal
feature to hide _ and * markup for _italic_, **bold** and ***bold
italic*** styled text in Markdown

See the vim-pencil plugin for details on automatically enabling this
feature.

For more details on Vim’s Conceal feature, see:

    :help conceallevel
    :help concealcursor

Usage
-----

Just like any other color scheme:

    :colorscheme pencil

You can toggle between the light and dark variants:

    :set background=dark
    :set background=light

Like any other color scheme, you can add these commands to your .vimrc.

Font choices
------------

iA Writer uses a typeface called ‘Nitti Light’ by Blue Monday. ($)

Free alternatives with bold and italic support include:

- Anonymous Pro (serif)
- Courier Prime (serif)
- Cousine
- DejaVu Sans Mono
- Fantasque Sans Mono
- Liberation
- Luxi Mono Regular (serif)
- Ubuntu Mono

Cousine is a good match for Nitti Light.
